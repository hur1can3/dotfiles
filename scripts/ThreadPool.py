Yet another thread pool module.

A thread pool consists of a set of worker threads for performing time consuming
operations concurrently. A minimal API provides a way to submit jobs (requests),
without waiting for them to finish, and get the results back in some way once
they are available. The thread pool is responsible for assigning jobs to the
worker threads by putting them in a job queue, where they are picked up by the
next available worker. The worker then performs the assigned job in the background
and puts the processed request in an output queue.

The main novelty of this module compared to other threadpool recipes is the way
results are returned to the client. Instead of providing a callback to post-process
the computed results, a L{generator <ThreadPool.iterProcessedJobs>} is used for
popping the processed jobs from the output queue and yielding them back to the
caller. The processed jobs encapsulate the computed result (or raised exception)
and can be used transparently by the calling thread, as if the computation didn't
take place in a different thread. This is more flexible than the callback-based
approach since it gives full control to the caller of when to ask for a result,
how long to wait for it and what to do with it once it is fetched.

After a C{JobRequest} is L{added <ThreadPool.addJob>} to a L{ThreadPool}, it can
be in one of the following states:
    1. Unassigned: The request is still in the input queue, no worker thread
    has been assigned to it yet. There are two substates:
        - Pending: The job is waiting its turn to be picked up by a L{Worker}.
        - Cancelled: The job has been L{cancelled <ThreadPool.cancelJob>} and,
          although it still occupies a slot in the input queue, it will be
          discarded when a L{Worker} picks it up.
    2. In progress: The job has been popped by the input queue by a L{Worker} and
       is in the process of being executed.
    3. Processed: The job has been processed (successfully or not) and has been
       added to the output queue, ready to be returned.
    4. Returned: The job has been returned to the client, either by
       L{ThreadPool.iterProcessedJobs} or L{ThreadPool.processedJobs} and is no
       longer associated with the threadpool.
A job in state 1.a, 2 or 3 is said to be I{active}.

B{Acknowledgements:} The basic concept and the initial implementation was taken
from the U{threadpool module of Christopher Arndt
<http://www.chrisarndt.de/en/software/python/threadpool/>}, who in turn borrowed
from the "Python in a Nutshell" book by Alex Martelli.
